## Environment Variables set-up

For anyone who wishes to clone your project and run it locally, you must set up the environment variables as follows:

-   env.test file created with "PGDATABASE=nc_news_test"
-   env.development file created with "PGDATABASE=nc_news"

These files will be included in the .gitignore file meaning they will not be pushed to GitHub (important if the databses are sensitive and not to be shared publicly).
